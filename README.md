This is an extension for Chrome browser for managing plurk emoticons outside the website. Still in heavy development. If you wanna to contribute, please consider for using vanilla JavaScript.

Anyway, please buy `Plurk Coin` to support Plurk! <img src="https://s.plurk.com/1c890273544559b17f090d09238fa763.gif">

If you buy `Plurk Coin`, you'll gain some extra features including larger emoticon pack capacity. So, again, We encourage you to buy `Plurk Coin` to support Plurk.

### Limitation

At the moment, Plurkemot paste your selected emot automatically to current text input and it is a full URL like <a href target="_blank">https://emos.plurk.com/ecd9d5cca5c3522a32208766e30e45b0_w48_h47.jpeg</a> which may decrease your spaces for other text in one plurk or comment.

We still trying to use Plurk API to store emot by upload.
